# Room Functionality TODO List

## Issues to Fix:

### 1. User List Display Issue
- **Problem**: Host can see other users' names and messages in chat, but users don't appear under "Users in Room" section
- **Status**: âœ… FIXED
- **Priority**: High
- **Solution**: Added backend endpoint to fetch room users and updated frontend to display both room participants and connected users

### 2. User History Snapshots
- **Problem**: User history snapshots in rooms are not working properly
- **Status**: âœ… IMPROVED
- **Priority**: High
- **Solution**: Enhanced frontend code history tracking and added room-specific submission history

### 3. Code Execution in Rooms
- **Problem**: When users in a room try to run code or submit code, it goes to a blank page instead of showing output
- **Status**: âœ… FIXED
- **Priority**: Critical
- **Solution**: Created room-specific execute and submit endpoints that use the room's problem context

## Backend Endpoints to Verify/Create:

### Room Management
- [x] GET /api/rooms/{room_code}/users - Get all users in a room
- [x] GET /api/rooms/code/{room_code} - Get room by code
- [x] POST /api/rooms/join/ - Join a room (existing)
- [x] POST /api/rooms/{room_code}/leave - Leave a room

### Code Execution in Rooms
- [x] POST /api/rooms/{room_code}/execute - Execute code in room context
- [x] POST /api/rooms/{room_code}/submit - Submit code in room context
- [x] GET /api/rooms/{room_code}/submissions - Get room submissions

### Real-time Updates
- [x] Socket.IO events for user join/leave (existing)
- [x] Socket.IO events for code execution results
- [x] Socket.IO events for user list updates (improved)

## Remaining Tasks:

### 4. Enhanced Real-time Features
- **Status**: âœ… COMPLETED
- **Tasks**:
  - [x] Broadcast code execution results to all room users
  - [x] Add real-time submission notifications
  - [x] Improve user presence indicators

### 5. Room Problem Display
- **Status**: âœ… COMPLETED
- **Tasks**:
  - [x] Display problem details in room
  - [x] Show problem description and test cases
  - [x] Add problem navigation within room

### 6. Error Handling & UX
- **Status**: âœ… IMPROVED
- **Tasks**:
  - [x] Add loading states for room data
  - [x] Add error handling for room access
  - [x] Improve user feedback for failed operations

## Deployment Status:
- **Status**: ðŸŸ¡ READY FOR DEPLOYMENT
- **Note**: All room functionality has been implemented and is ready for deployment to production

## Testing Checklist:
- [ ] Test user list synchronization across multiple browsers (Ready after deployment)
- [ ] Test code execution and submission in rooms (Ready after deployment)
- [ ] Test real-time chat and code sharing (Ready after deployment)
- [ ] Test user history and submission tracking (Ready after deployment)
- [ ] Test error scenarios (invalid room codes, network issues) (Ready after deployment)

## Summary of Completed Work:

### Backend Improvements:
1. âœ… Added room-specific code execution endpoint (`POST /api/rooms/{room_code}/execute`)
2. âœ… Added room-specific code submission endpoint (`POST /api/rooms/{room_code}/submit`)
3. âœ… Added room users endpoint (`GET /api/rooms/{room_code}/users`)
4. âœ… Added get room by code endpoint (`GET /api/rooms/code/{room_code}`)
5. âœ… Added leave room endpoint (`POST /api/rooms/{room_code}/leave`)
6. âœ… Added room submissions history endpoint (`GET /api/rooms/{room_code}/submissions`)
7. âœ… Added real-time socket events for code execution and submission
8. âœ… Fixed Room schema to include participants

### Frontend Improvements:
1. âœ… Fixed user list display to show both room participants and connected users
2. âœ… Updated code execution to use room-specific endpoints
3. âœ… Updated code submission to use room-specific endpoints
4. âœ… Added room data fetching and error handling
5. âœ… Added problem display in room with toggle functionality
6. âœ… Enhanced real-time notifications for code execution and submissions
7. âœ… Improved user presence indicators and history tracking
8. âœ… Added loading states and better error handling

### Key Features Implemented:
- **Room-based Code Execution**: Users can now run and submit code within room context
- **Real-time User Synchronization**: Proper user list display with online/offline status
- **Problem Integration**: Room displays the associated problem with description and test cases
- **Submission History**: Users can view submission history for all room participants
- **Enhanced Real-time Features**: Live notifications for code execution and submissions
- **Better UX**: Loading states, error handling, and user feedback

## Next Steps:
1. Deploy the updated backend to production
2. Test all functionality in production environment
3. Monitor for any issues and fix as needed
