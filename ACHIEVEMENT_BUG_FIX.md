# Achievement Bug Fix

## Issue
The AchievementsPage was throwing a JavaScript error:
```
Uncaught TypeError: Cannot read properties of undefined (reading 'startsWith')
```

## Root Cause
The `get_user_achievements` function in the backend was not including the `condition_type` and `condition_value` fields in the API response, even though the frontend was expecting them for achievement categorization.

## Fix Applied

### Backend Fix (`backend/app/utils/achievements.py`)
Updated the `get_user_achievements` function to include the missing fields:

```python
achievement_data = {
    "id": achievement.id,
    "name": achievement.name,
    "description": achievement.description,
    "icon": achievement.icon,
    "condition_type": achievement.condition_type,  # ✅ Added
    "condition_value": achievement.condition_value,  # ✅ Added
    "xp_reward": achievement.xp_reward,
    "earned": achievement.id in earned_dict,
    "earned_at": None,
    "progress": 0,
    "total": achievement.condition_value or 1
}
```

### Frontend Type Safety
Ensured the TypeScript interface correctly defines these fields as required:

```typescript
export interface Achievement {
  id: number;
  name: string;
  description: string;
  icon: string;
  condition_type: string;  // ✅ Required field
  condition_value: number; // ✅ Required field
  xp_reward: number;
  earned?: boolean;
  earned_at?: string;
  progress?: number;
  total?: number;
}
```

## Result
- ✅ JavaScript error resolved
- ✅ Achievement categorization now works correctly
- ✅ AchievementsPage displays achievements grouped by category
- ✅ Build successful with no errors

## Testing
- Backend API now returns complete achievement data including `condition_type`
- Frontend build compiles successfully
- Achievement categorization logic works as expected
